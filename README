DESCRIPTION

Prerequisites
=============
You must have the following installed before installing gmseg:

- Python_ 2.5.1
- HDF5_ 1.6.5

Additionally, the Sunflower setup script will automatically install
the following packages or newer versions:

- NumPy_ 1.0.5
- path.py 2.2
- PyTables_ 2.0
- setuptools
- textinput 0.1.1

In order for automatic prerequisite installation to work, you either
need write access to your Python installation's site-packages
directory, or to configured setuptools to install into your
home directory automatically (see hint below).

.. _GCC: http://gcc.gnu.org/
.. _HDF5: http://www.hdfgroup.org/
.. _NumPy: http://numpy.scipy.org/
.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
.. _PyTables: http://www.pytables.org/

Hints on installing the prerequisites in your home directory
------------------------------------------------------------
To install the prerequisites, the easiest thing to do is use your
system's package manager. This may require you to be root. If you
aren't, here are some hints on how to install things within your home
directory. Check to make sure the packages aren't already available on
your system first.

Configuration and directory setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This will create some directories for you to store your own
libraries. In case you are using a multiplatform system, binary
libraries go into specific directories for each platform under your
home directory. For example, on a Linux x86_64 system,
platform-specific code goes in ``~/arch/Linux-x86_64``.

You'll need stuff like this in your ``~/.bashrc`` to determine your
platform and set up appropriate paths::

  export ARCH=$(uname)-$(uname -m)

  export PATH=${HOME}/arch/${ARCH}/bin:${HOME}/arch/${ARCH}/opt/python-2.5.1/bin:${HOME}/bin:${PATH}

  unset PYTHONHOME

  PYTHON_VERSION=2.5
  export PYTHONPATH=${HOME}/arch/${ARCH}/lib/python${PYTHON_VERSION}:${HOME}/lib/python${PYTHON_VERSION}

  export HDF5_DIR=${HOME}/arch/${ARCH}/opt/hdf5-1.6.6

You'll also need to load this configuration for the rest of these
hints, and create the appropriate directories. Run this from the bash
prompt::

  source ~/.bashrc
  mkdir -p ${HOME}/arch/${ARCH}/lib/python${PYTHON_VERSION} \
    ${HOME}/lib/python${PYTHON_VERSION} ${HOME}/arch/${ARCH}/bin \
    ${HOME}/bin:${PATH} ${HOME}/arch/${ARCH}/opt

HDF5
~~~~
Download the HDF5 source tarball, build, test, and install it::

  wget ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/current/src/hdf5-1.6.6.tar.gz
  tar zxvf hdf5-1.6.6.tar.gz
  cd hdf5-1.6.6
  ./configure --prefix=${HDF5_DIR}
  make
  make install

Python
~~~~~~
If you're using MacOS or Windows, there are binaries available at
<http://www.python.org/download/>. If not, you can download the source
tarball, build, test, and install it::

  wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.5.1/Python-2.5.1.tar.bz2
  tar jxvf Python-2.5.1.tar.bz2
  cd Python-2.5.1
  ./configure --prefix=~/arch/${ARCH}/opt/python-2.5.1
  LD_RUN_PATH=${HDF5_DIR}:${LD_RUN_PATH} make
  make install

Setuptools
~~~~~~~~~~
To get setuptools to automatically install packages within your home
directory, put this in ``~/.pydistutils.cfg``::

  [install]
  prefix = ~
  exec_prefix = ~/arch/$ARCH
  install_platlib = $platbase/lib/python$py_version_short
  install_purelib = $base/lib/python$py_version_short
  install_scripts = $platbase/bin

  [easy_install]
  install_dir = $platbase/lib/python$py_version_short
  script_dir = $platbase/bin

You must set ``$ARCH`` as above in your .bashrc. The other variables
will be determined by Python.
