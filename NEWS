0.1.0a4:

* understandable structure files (e.g. "obs0" becomes "h3k27me3")
* save log likelihood files

0.1.0a3:

Files from previous versions are no longer compatible.

* Binary output of observations for GMTK. This means it takes a few
  minutes to write out observations for the whole genome before
  training or Viterbi rather than many hours.
* Output of segment lengths for diagnostic purposes.
* Changed observation storage from float32 to float64.
* Faster conversion of Viterbi output files to wiggle tracks.
* Observation files now have more descriptive names.

0.1.0a2:

Files from previous versions are no longer compatible.

* Efficient multiple random start EM training queue submission
* Addition of h5histogram command
* Limiting data analyzed to a particular region with --include-region
* More efficient data loading
* Some interface and file format changes
* Performance improvements
* Bugfixes
