0.1.0a5:

* new segway option: --distribution: choices are norm, gamma
* default distribution is now norm
* _load_data: add support for wigFix with step, span values set
* _util.py: mark some functions for replacement with genomedata

0.1.0a4:

* Now requires optbuild>0.1.4
* Understandable structure files (e.g. the name for observation track "obs0" becomes "h3k27me3")
* Save log likelihood files
* Rename segway-load-seq -> genomedata-load-seq
* Rename segway-load-data -> genomedata-load-data
* Rename segway-name-tracks -> genomedata-name-tracks
* New command genomedata-save-metadata
* New command: _load_data: load data quickly (in C)

(These five commands will eventually be split out into a new genomedata package)

* New command: segway-calc-distance: calculate distance between identified segments and an external BED feature file
* New command: gtf2bed: convert GTF to BED format

* New segway option --track: use only a particular track
* Generate a "dinucleotide" track when specified with --track
* New segway option --prior-strength: uses dirichlet tables on seg_seg transition CPT
* segway --help now uses option groups

* New h5histogram options: --include-identify, --identify-label: now
  allows getting histogram per identified segment
* New h5histogram option: --num-bins: allow specification of number of histogram bins

* identification output files are now gzipped bed rather than wig
* rename "nonmissing" to "presence" throughout
* Move from normal distribution to gamma distribution
* Calculate starting parameters based on something close to the maximum likelihood estimation plus jitter
* Hacky (and wrong) support for memory requirements for up to six
  observation tracks, will be redone when GMTK memory optimization is
  done

* better handling of errors and KeyboardInterrupts during parallel operation of segway
* Stops using deprecated -inputTrainableParameters option to GMTK

* Checking for unset metadata before using genomedata files
* Corrections to README
* Bugfixes

0.1.0a3:

Files from previous versions are no longer compatible.

* Binary output of observations for GMTK. This means it takes a few
  minutes to write out observations for the whole genome before
  training or Viterbi rather than many hours.
* Output of segment lengths for diagnostic purposes.
* Changed observation storage from float32 to float64.
* Faster conversion of Viterbi output files to wiggle tracks.
* Observation files now have more descriptive names.

0.1.0a2:

Files from previous versions are no longer compatible.

* Efficient multiple random start EM training queue submission
* Addition of h5histogram command
* Limiting data analyzed to a particular region with --include-region
* More efficient data loading
* Some interface and file format changes
* Performance improvements
* Bugfixes
