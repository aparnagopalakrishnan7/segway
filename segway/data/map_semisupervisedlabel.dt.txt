map_parent
2              % num parents
% first parent is the label: 0 = no label; 1 = label
% second parent is target: 0 when the label is set
    0 2 0 default
        % no label
        -1 { 1 } % doesn't matter, observed child is always true

        % label set
        1 2 0 default
            -1 { 1 } % label set, target is zero -> always true
            -1 { 0 } % label set, target is nonzero -> impossible
